# BottleSortingRobot
Software for Autonomous Bottle Sorting Robot

This project is a robot that sorts plastic bottles of different types into separate receptacles to help improve the efficiency of bottle recycling. This repository contains the entire C codebase used to program a PIC18F4620 microcontroller controlling the robot. It includes the autonomous control logic, the user interface, date/time recording, and a PC interface.

This robot won 1st place in an annual robotics competition featuring over 30 other teams.
